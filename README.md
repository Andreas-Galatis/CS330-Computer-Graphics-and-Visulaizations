# CS330-Computer-Graphics-and-Visualizations
Projects using OpenGL with C++ to design complex 3D objects with textures and lighting

**How do I approach designing software?**
The most important aspect of software design is speaking to the client and other stakeholders to capture the vision they have for that software. A clear understanding of the requirements cannot be understated. Collaboration is also an importat factor. Bu tapping into the wide network of computer graphic artists that have created a vast array of designs, the client can be presented with many options to draw inspiration from. 


**How do I approach developing programs?**
Good program is done in phases and iterations in a dynamic way. Software development needs and solutions can change rapidly, therefore it is important not to be too bound by a rigid long-term planning method. Planning is still needed, but the focus should be on collecting as much information as possible by ways of requirements gathering, active stakeholder communication and engagement, as well as a great team building mechanism structured around empowering leaders that will provide the team everything they need to be successful, while also giving them the room to be creative and make decisions on their own.

In this project for example, each week the design for the application we were building evolved as new requirements were added. One week we added camera controls, another week we added textures, and lastly we added lighting elements. Thankfully since the program was done in iterations, once one phase was completed, tested, and reviewed to be satisfactory, adding a new component was not complicated. 


**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
To be a full-rounded computer scientist means to also understand computer graphics and visualization. Computer graphics are essential mainly for the user experience and overall beautificaton of an application. With goals of becoming a full-stack developer, knowing what it takes to create and implement good design and bring it to completion is important.
